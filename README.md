Computer Programming 2
Module 3 Exercise 1

Instruction: A class Person is given below as your base class. Your task is to create a class
Employee which will contain objects of records for an employee and derived from the class
Person.

Guideline for an employee record:
• employee's name (which is inherited from the class Person)
• annual salary represented (type double)
• year the employee started work (type int)
• company ID number (type String) with a format of EMPXXX (where X are numbers)

Create constructors and accessor methods which you think are needed for this program, as
well as another method (print) to print out all the employee’s data once you call that
method.

Further, you will also create Contractual and Permanent Employee that shall inherit fields
and methods from class Employee. Assume additional fields and methods for Contractual
and Permanent employee. Explain in comments why additional fields and methods are
needed or unique for each class.

Finally, create your TestEmployee class which will contain a main method to fully test your
class definition.
